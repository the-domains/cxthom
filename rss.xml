            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Massimo Vignelli's Signed 2012 NYC Subway Diagram</h1><p>Less than one year ago, the world lost one of its most important creative minds with the passing of Massimo Vignelli. The celebrated graphic designer bestowed upon us a great number of now-iconic designs, though perhaps none more visibly lasting than his 1972 MTA New York City Transit subway map.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8f32d0a35a78621feb4c771f37440467815b250e.jpg"></article>]]></description>
